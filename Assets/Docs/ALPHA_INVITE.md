Hi [name],

I am making a game about creating, sharing, and playing small action-adventure levels with a mix of combat and puzzle-solving. Making a game is a challenging, iterative process, so I am hoping you would be willing to try the game out and give me feedback. I currently need feedback to help steer the direction of the game's development as well as ensure that the game is fun. The feedback I get will determine if I decide to continue working on the project, so it would help me immensely to get honest and detailed information about your play experience.

If you are interested in regular testing, we will be using Discord to communicate about the game. If you aren't familiar with Discord, it is a chat app similar to Skype and Slack. New builds will show up there on a regular basis. The Discord channel is here: https://discord.gg/7ByVx8R Alternatively, I would also appreciate any feedback to this email address.

NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT SHARE ANY BUILDS, SCREENSHOTS, OR DETAILS ABOUT THE GAME ONLINE OUTSIDE OF THE DISCORD.

Thanks for your time, and I hope you join us!
