# Template email for invites to pre-alpha

Hi [name],

I am in the process of making a game about creating, sharing, and playing small action-adventure levels (ala Zelda). If you are receiving this email, it's because I thought you might be interested in testing it out. Making a game is a challenging, iterative process, so I would really appreciate your feedback. Note that this game is in extremely early stages (pre-alpha), so I'm keeping the group of testers very small. Consider yourself lucky!

We will be using Discord to communicate about the game. If you aren't familiar with Discord, it is a chat app similar to Skype and Slack. New builds will show up there on a regular basis. The Discord channel is here: https://discord.gg/7ByVx8R

NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT SHARE ANY BUILDS, SCREENSHOTS, OR DETAILS ABOUT THE GAME ONLINE OUTSIDE OF THE DISCORD.

I hope you join us!

Thanks,
Zack Litzsinger
