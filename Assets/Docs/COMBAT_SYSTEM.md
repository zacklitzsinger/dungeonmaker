## Current combat system
- Melee attack
- Combo system (can input in advance with benefit for precise timing)
- Shield (blocks enemy attacks)
- Knockback on melee attacks and shield blocks
- Dash move

## Problems with current system
- No decisions (move towards enemy with shield drawn and hit them repeatedly til dead)
- Dash feels pretty bad
- Most enemies are not very aggressive
- Enemies are visible from the second you enter the room
- Melee attacks are very liberal in hitting, aiming is not a challenge

## Combat system goals
- Fluid: should control very well, should provide good range of motion since limited by 2D
- Dangerous: should feel inherently risky but rewarding when done well
- Modular: would be nice for the player to be able to customize their layout
- Skillful: ability to really push the limits of the character

## New combat system
- Projectile-based instead of melee based
- Varying weapon types, limited ammo
- Modular suit (slot in different sources of power, everything runs on power)
  - Shooting, moving, rolling all use power
  - Overdrawing will require power to hit max before consuming again
- Limited defensive options, reliant on dodging
- Aggressive enemies
- Controls:
  - Left click to shoot, right click to aim, middle mouse to switch weapons
  - Space to roll
- Adapt combo system to new style where applicable
- Overdraw: When below a certain power threshold, attacks do additional damage, mobility options are better, etc. However, taking damage will stun you and cause you to explode, dealing damage to enemies near you

## Enemy ideas
- Some enemies appear when you get too close
- Almost all enemies are directly confrontational
- Enemies that explode when they die
- Enemies that shoot back
- Fast enemies that charge at player (much faster than current dash enemies)
- Enemies that sap power
