# Testing Notes
## Thoughts
- Circuit system becomes visual noise when it gets complicated. Need to throw in context sensitive information, different colors, curved lines, etc.
- More basic logic blocks would be cool (permanent block, timer blocks, delay blocks, etc.)
- Visually need to distinguish rooms better. Kind of lame to be able to see into adjacent rooms. Sense of discovery should be better
- Need ability to make visual clues
- Need combat to break up puzzle segments
