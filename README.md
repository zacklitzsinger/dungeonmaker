# Dungeon Maker
Dungeon Maker game I worked on for a few months in Unity about creating and playing Zelda-style dungeons. It featured a fully featured level editor allowing for placement of 3D objects into a 2D grid. Levels could be uploaded to an online server and then played by other players. The gameplay is similar to Zelda and includes puzzle-solving and a combo-based combat system. More complicated logic could utilize a built in circuit system, which was modelled to behave similarly to a real world logic system and yet avoid overcomplicating the engine. The game requires a web server to be run, which is located [here](https://github.com/zelitzsi/dungeonmaker-web-server).
